# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be respectful. Don't be a jerk. We're all here to build useful things.

## The Longer Version

This project and its community welcome contributions from everyone. We expect all participants — contributors, reviewers, maintainers, and users — to:

**Be respectful.** Disagreements happen. Critique ideas, not people. If someone's code has problems, explain why clearly and constructively.

**Be honest.** If you don't know something, say so. If you made a mistake, own it. We learn faster together.

**Be patient.** This is an open source project maintained in spare time. Maintainers will respond as quickly as they can.

**Be mindful of security.** If you find a vulnerability, report it privately via [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md). Do not post exploit details publicly.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks of any kind
- Posting others' private information without permission
- Submitting plugins that steal credentials, exfiltrate data, or harm users
- Spam, off-topic issues, or low-effort submissions intended to game the contributor count

## Enforcement

Issues, PRs, or comments that violate this code of conduct will be removed. Repeat offenders will be blocked from the repository.
